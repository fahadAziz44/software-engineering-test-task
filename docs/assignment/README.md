# Project Origin

This project originated as a technical assessment for a backend engineering role. The original requirements can be found in [ORIGINAL_TASK.md](./ORIGINAL_TASK.md).

## From Assignment to Production

What started as a coding test evolved into a comprehensive exploration of production-grade backend architecture. While the assignment required basic CRUD operations and Docker deployment, I used it as an opportunity to learn and implement:

- **Zero-downtime Kubernetes deployments** on GKE Autopilot
- **Multi-environment CI/CD pipelines** with progressive deployment strategies
- **Production observability** with structured logging and health probes
- **Security hardening** through minimal Docker images and least-privilege containers
- **Infrastructure as Code** with declarative Kubernetes manifests

## What I Learned

This project became a deep dive into the full lifecycle of backend systems:

- **Go ecosystem**: Clean architecture patterns, testing strategies, and idiomatic code
- **Docker optimization**: Multi-stage builds, distroless images, and security contexts
- **Kubernetes operations**: Rolling updates, health probes, resource management, and multi-environment isolation
- **DevOps practices**: CI/CD pipelines, automated quality gates, and deployment strategies
- **Production thinking**: How to ship safely, observe effectively, and recover quickly

## Transformation

After completing the assignment, I engineered this into a **production-grade microservice** that demonstrates real-world backend engineering practices. The system is now suitable for:

- Portfolio demonstrations
- Starting point for new microservices
- Learning reference for Go/Kubernetes architecture
- Production deployment patterns

The current state goes far beyond the original requirements and represents the type of system I'd build for production use.
